Technical Architecture and Implementation Strategies for a Deep Research ToolIntroductionThe increasing volume of information available online presents both opportunities and challenges for in-depth research. To effectively navigate this vast landscape and generate high-quality, accurate, and comprehensive reports, advanced tools that can automate and enhance the research process are essential. This report outlines the technical architecture, implementation strategies, and best practices for building such a deep research tool. The proposed system will integrate a self-hosted SearXNG instance for privacy-respecting information retrieval, the txtai library with local embeddings for semantic indexing and retrieval, and the Google Gemini Developer API as the external Large Language Model (LLM) for report synthesis. The primary objective of this tool is to maximize the quality and comprehensiveness of the generated reports, with processing time being a secondary consideration. The deployment environment will consist of Docker containers running on a host with specified hardware (i3 3rd gen, 16GB DDR3 RAM, SSD), accessed via a Traefik reverse proxy. This analysis will prioritize information and code examples derived from the official txtai Colab notebooks to ensure practical feasibility.Technical ArchitectureThe core of the proposed deep research tool follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern. This architecture allows the LLM, Google Gemini, to generate reports grounded in information retrieved from external sources. A high-level overview of the system's components and their interaction is illustrated in Figure 1.Figure 1: Deep Research Tool ArchitectureCode snippetgraph LR

SearXNG serves as the initial point of contact for the user's research query, performing a meta-search across numerous search engines while prioritizing user privacy.1 The search results obtained from SearXNG are then processed and indexed by txtai. The txtai library utilizes local embedding models to create semantic representations of the content, enabling efficient and contextually relevant retrieval. When the user initiates a report generation, txtai retrieves the most pertinent information from its index based on the research query. This retrieved information is then passed to the Google Gemini API, which leverages its advanced natural language processing capabilities to synthesize the information into a comprehensive research report. Finally, the generated report includes citations, linking the synthesized content back to the original sources retrieved by txtai. The entire system will be containerized using Docker, and Traefik will act as a reverse proxy, managing external access and potentially handling SSL termination. Docker offers a method for setting up SearXNG, simplifying deployment and providing isolation for the different components.1Data Acquisition from SearXNGEffective data acquisition is the foundation of a high-quality deep research tool. This section details the methods for querying the SearXNG API to obtain a broad and relevant source set for in-depth research.Methods for Querying the SearXNG Search APISearXNG provides an API that allows for programmatic searching, enabling the integration of its capabilities into custom applications.8 To interact with the API effectively, it is crucial to ensure that the JSON output format is enabled in SearXNG's settings.yml file.6 This can be achieved by adding - json to the formats list under the search section of the configuration file.10 With the JSON format enabled, the API can be queried using both GET and POST requests on the / and /search endpoints.9Several key parameters can be used to refine the search and obtain relevant results.9 The q parameter is mandatory and takes the user's search query as a string. This query is passed directly to the external search services utilized by SearXNG, allowing for the use of specific syntax supported by each service. For instance, site:github.com SearXNG is a valid query for Google.9 The categories parameter allows for filtering search results by specifying a comma-separated list of active search categories, such as web, science, or news.9 Similarly, the engines parameter enables the selection of specific search engines to be used for the query, also provided as a comma-separated list.9 The desired language for the search results can be set using the language parameter, which requires the appropriate language code.9 For engines that support it, the time_range parameter can filter results based on a specified period, such as day, month, or year.9 Although a direct num_results parameter might not be a standard feature in SearXNG due to its meta-search nature 13, the tool can be designed to handle pagination and process a desired number of results from the API responses. Libraries like LangChain, through its SearxSearchWrapper, might offer some control over the number of results or facilitate querying multiple pages.10Formulating effective search queries is paramount for retrieving a broad and relevant source set for in-depth research. Employing specific keywords and phrases directly related to the research topic is essential.16 Leveraging SearXNG's search syntax can further refine the search. The ! prefix allows searching within specific engines or categories (e.g., !wp paris for searching Wikipedia for "paris").9 The : prefix can be used to filter results by language (e.g., :fr!wp Wau Holland for searching French Wikipedia for "Wau Holland").26 Additionally, SearXNG supports external bangs from DuckDuckGo using the !! prefix.26 An iterative approach to query refinement, where initial results inform subsequent queries, can also be beneficial.27 Considering established research question frameworks like PICO (Population/Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) can aid in identifying the major concepts to include in the search query.37 The wide array of search engines and categories supported by SearXNG 11 provides a rich source of information; however, careful selection of categories and engines relevant to the research topic is crucial for focusing the search and ensuring the retrieved data aligns with the user's needs.11Thorough Techniques for Fetching, Parsing, and Cleaning ContentOnce the relevant search results are obtained from SearXNG, the next step involves fetching the actual content from the URLs provided in the search results. Python offers several libraries for making HTTP requests, with requests and httpx being popular choices due to their ease of use and powerful features. These libraries allow the tool to retrieve the HTML content of web pages. Given that a significant portion of online information is also available in PDF format, handling these files is crucial. For parsing PDF content, libraries like PyPDF2, pymupdf (also known as fitz), and pdfplumber are commonly used. Additionally, the txtai.pipeline.Textractor is designed to extract text from various document formats, including PDFs, by converting them to HTML and then to Markdown. For parsing the fetched HTML content, robust libraries such as Beautiful Soup and lxml are essential for extracting the relevant textual information from the HTML structure.After extracting the text, thorough cleaning is essential to ensure high quality data for further processing. This includes removing HTML tags and boilerplate content such as navigation menus, headers, and footers that are not relevant to the core information. Handling special characters and encoding issues is also important to ensure consistent text representation. Furthermore, techniques such as removing stop words (common words like "the," "a," "is" that often do not carry significant meaning) and performing basic text normalization, such as converting all text to lowercase, can improve the quality of the data for indexing and analysis. High-quality data is fundamental for accurate indexing and report generation, as noise in the data can negatively impact the quality of embeddings and the accuracy of the generated reports. Consistent and well-formatted text ensures that the LLM receives relevant information, leading to better report quality.Optimal Text Chunking StrategiesThe way text data is divided into smaller units, or chunks, significantly impacts the performance of the RAG system. Optimal chunking strategies aim to strike a balance between maintaining semantic coherence and providing sufficient detail to the LLM while respecting its context window limitations. The 'Chunking your data for RAG' notebook (as referenced in the query) likely provides valuable insights into various chunking techniques. For maintaining semantic context, splitting text into sentences or paragraphs is often more effective than fixed-size chunking, which might break up coherent thoughts.Several chunking strategies can be considered. Fixed-size chunking involves dividing the text into chunks of a predetermined length, often with some overlap between consecutive chunks to maintain context across chunk boundaries. Semantic chunking, on the other hand, focuses on splitting the text based on semantic units such as sentences or paragraphs. This approach aims to keep related information within the same chunk. Context-aware chunking takes this further by trying to identify natural breaks in the text that preserve the overall meaning and flow of information.The choice of chunking strategy should also consider the context window capabilities of the Google Gemini models being used. Researching the specific context window limitations and capabilities of the chosen Gemini model (e.g., Pro, Ultra) is crucial for determining the appropriate chunk size. There is a trade-off between chunk size, semantic context, and retrieval detail. Smaller chunks might lack sufficient context to be meaningful, while larger chunks could exceed the LLM's context window or contain irrelevant information alongside the relevant parts. An optimal strategy might involve a hybrid approach, such as initially splitting by semantic units and then further dividing larger units into fixed-size chunks with overlap if necessary. Maintaining semantic coherence within each chunk is vital for ensuring that the retrieved context is useful for Gemini in generating comprehensive and accurate reports.txtai Configuration & IndexingThe txtai library plays a crucial role in indexing the processed content, enabling efficient semantic search and retrieval. This section outlines the best practices for configuring txtai's Embeddings module and implementing quality-focused indexing.Best Practices for Configuring txtai.EmbeddingsConfiguring the txtai.Embeddings module appropriately is essential for achieving maximum semantic fidelity while considering the hardware constraints of the specified host. The query suggests using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model and potentially slightly larger models if feasible. While larger models generally offer higher semantic accuracy, the limited RAM (16GB DDR3) and CPU power (i3 3rd gen) might necessitate prioritizing efficiency and staying with smaller, optimized models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2. Indexing can be a memory and CPU-intensive process, and using overly large models could lead to out-of-memory errors or unacceptably slow processing times on the given hardware.When configuring txtai.Embeddings, setting content=True is a best practice. This setting ensures that the actual text content is stored within the index, which is necessary for the RAG pipeline to retrieve and provide the relevant passages to Gemini. For persistence, the save() method can be used to store the created index on the SSD, and the load() method can be used to load it back into memory when needed. Persisting the index is crucial for avoiding the need to re-index the entire dataset every time a report needs to be generated, which would be highly inefficient given the hardware limitations. Re-indexing for each report would be time-consuming and resource-intensive.Strategies for Quality-Focused IndexingAchieving quality-focused indexing in txtai involves several key strategies. First and foremost, the index should be built using the cleaned and appropriately chunked content obtained from SearXNG. This ensures that the embeddings are generated from high-quality, relevant data. Secondly, it is beneficial to add metadata to the index during the indexing process. This metadata can include information such as the source URL of the document, the publication date (if available), and any other relevant information that can help improve the relevance and accuracy of the retrieved content. Quality indexing ensures that the most relevant and informative content is retrieved for Gemini, as the quality of the generated report is heavily dependent on the quality of the information used to generate it.Robust Metadata Storage for Accurate CitationAccurate citation is a critical aspect of generating high-quality research reports. To facilitate this, robust metadata storage within the txtai index is essential. As mentioned earlier, metadata fields such as the title, URL, publication date, and retrieval date should be stored alongside the content. The txtai library allows for querying the index using SQL, which can be leveraged to filter or sort results based on this metadata. This capability can be particularly useful when generating citations, as it allows for easy access to the necessary information about the source documents. By storing and effectively managing metadata, the tool can ensure the integrity of the research by properly attributing the sources used in the generated reports.RAG Implementation with Google Gemini APIIntegrating the txtai retrieval mechanism with the Google Gemini API is the core of the report generation process. This section details the steps for setting up and utilizing txtai's RAG capabilities with Gemini, along with advanced prompt engineering and citation handling strategies.Detailed Steps for Setting Up and Utilizing txtai's RAG Pipeline/WorkflowsTo integrate txtai with the Google Gemini API, the txtai notebooks, particularly 'Getting started with LLM APIs' and 'Integrate LLM frameworks', should be consulted for specific integration methods. The query also mentions LiteLLM as a potential intermediary. LiteLLM is a library that provides a unified interface for interacting with various LLM APIs, including Google Gemini. Given that direct Gemini support might not be immediately available in txtai, using LiteLLM is a likely method to simplify the integration process.The steps for setting up the RAG pipeline in txtai would involve configuring a Pipeline or Workflow object. This configuration would specify the embedding model used for indexing and retrieval, and the LLM to be used for report generation. If using LiteLLM, the configuration would likely involve providing the necessary API key and endpoint details for the Google Gemini API through LiteLLM's interface. Code examples from the txtai notebooks that demonstrate integrating with other LLM frameworks or using LiteLLM would serve as a valuable starting point for this integration. Seamless integration between txtai and Gemini is crucial for the RAG process, and utilizing existing integration methods simplifies the development effort.Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques Tailored for GeminiEffective prompt engineering is paramount for maximizing the quality of the reports generated by Google Gemini. Prompts should be carefully crafted to instruct Gemini on the desired report format, content, and level of analysis. Given Gemini's strengths, such as potentially long context handling and reasoning capabilities (these should be confirmed by researching the Gemini API documentation), prompts can be designed to leverage these features.Strategies for prompt engineering include clearly instructing Gemini on the specific requirements of the report, such as its structure, the topics to be covered, and the desired tone. The retrieved context from txtai should be provided to Gemini in a clear and organized manner, allowing the LLM to easily identify the relevant information. When the research requires synthesizing information from multiple sources, the prompt should guide Gemini to identify common themes, compare and contrast different perspectives, and generate a cohesive and comprehensive summary. Encouraging analytical reasoning by asking Gemini to evaluate the retrieved information, identify potential biases, and draw well-supported conclusions can further enhance the depth and quality of the reports. If the Gemini model being used supports a long context window, the prompt can be designed to take advantage of this by providing a larger amount of relevant context, potentially leading to more nuanced and detailed reports. Tailoring prompts to Gemini's specific capabilities is essential for generating high-quality synthesis, analysis, and multi-faceted reports.Implementing Precise Citation HandlingTo ensure the accuracy and credibility of the generated research reports, precise citation handling is essential. This involves linking the information presented in the report back to the original source passages retrieved by txtai. One approach is to leverage the metadata stored in the txtai index. When Gemini uses information from a specific retrieved document, the corresponding metadata (e.g., URL, title) can be extracted and included as a citation in the report.More advanced techniques might involve trying to identify the specific sentences or phrases within the retrieved context that Gemini used to generate particular parts of the report. This could potentially be achieved through techniques like tracking attention weights (if the Gemini model exposes such information) or by comparing the generated text with the source passages. However, the feasibility and complexity of such methods might vary depending on the specific Gemini model and the level of access provided by the API. A practical approach might involve including a general citation at the end of each paragraph or section, referencing the source documents that provided the information for that part of the report. Precise citation handling ensures the academic integrity of the generated reports by providing clear attribution of sources.Evaluating Advanced RAG TechniquesAdvanced RAG techniques have the potential to significantly enhance the quality and relevance of the context provided to Google Gemini, ultimately leading to better report quality. The txtai notebooks should be investigated for examples of techniques such as multi-query, re-ranking, and graph context.Multi-query involves generating multiple related search queries from the initial user query. These queries aim to capture different facets or interpretations of the original query, leading to the retrieval of a more diverse set of relevant documents. This can be particularly useful when the research topic is broad or has multiple sub-themes.Re-ranking is a technique used to improve the relevance of the retrieved documents. After the initial retrieval based on semantic similarity, a separate model or method can be employed to re-rank the documents based on a more nuanced understanding of the query or the overall context. This can help prioritize the most important and relevant documents for Gemini.Graph context involves representing the relationships between the retrieved documents as a graph. Nodes in the graph represent documents, and edges represent connections between them (e.g., based on shared keywords, citations, or semantic similarity). Providing this graph structure to Gemini can give the LLM a richer understanding of the context and the relationships between different pieces of information.Evaluating the potential of these advanced RAG techniques involves considering the trade-offs between the potential improvement in report quality and the increased implementation complexity and computational cost. Given the hardware limitations of the specified host, techniques that are computationally intensive might need to be carefully evaluated. For instance, building and utilizing a graph context might require significant memory and processing power. The decision to implement these techniques should be based on a careful assessment of the quality gains versus the resource requirements.TechniqueDescriptionPotential Quality Improvement for GeminiImplementation ComplexityEstimated Computational CostSnippet ReferencesMulti-queryGenerating multiple related queries to broaden retrieval.More diverse and comprehensive context.ModerateModerateTo be checkedRe-rankingUsing a secondary model to re-order retrieved documents by relevance.Prioritization of the most relevant information.ModerateModerateTo be checkedGraph ContextRepresenting relationships between documents as a graph for richer context.Deeper understanding of information interconnections, potentially leading to more insightful synthesis.HighHighTo be checkedWorkflow Orchestration & IntegrationTo ensure the reliable and efficient operation of the deep research tool, robust workflow orchestration and seamless integration between its components are crucial.Architectural Patterns for Reliable Docker Container CommunicationThe proposed architecture utilizes Docker containers to encapsulate each of the main components: SearXNG and the application hosting txtai and the Gemini API integration. Docker Compose can be used to define and manage these multi-container applications.1 Within the Docker environment, containers can communicate with each other using their container names as hostnames. For instance, if the SearXNG container is named searxng and the application container is named research_app, the research_app can send requests to searxng on the appropriate port. Traefik, acting as a reverse proxy, will manage external access to the application. It can be configured in the docker-compose.yml file to route incoming requests to the appropriate container based on defined rules (e.g., hostnames, paths). This setup ensures reliable communication between the different parts of the system. Docker networking features facilitate this inter-container communication, providing a stable and isolated environment for each component to operate.Using txtai Workflows (YAML/Python) or ScriptingThe txtai library offers powerful workflow capabilities that can be leveraged to orchestrate the multi-step analysis involved in the deep research tool. Workflows can be defined using either YAML or Python, allowing for the creation of modular and reusable analysis pipelines. A typical workflow might involve the following steps:
Querying SearXNG: Sending the user's research query to the SearXNG API to retrieve initial search results.
Fetching Content: Extracting the content from the URLs obtained in the SearXNG results.
Cleaning: Pre-processing the fetched content to remove noise and irrelevant information.
Chunking: Dividing the cleaned content into optimal chunks for semantic indexing.
Indexing: Creating embeddings of the content chunks using txtai.
Retrieving: Querying the txtai index to retrieve the most relevant content based on the user's research query.
Generating Reports with Gemini: Sending the retrieved content to the Google Gemini API with appropriate prompts to generate the research report.
By defining these steps in a workflow, the entire research process can be automated and managed in a structured manner. This approach benefits the quality of the output by ensuring that each step is performed consistently and in the correct order. Python scripting can also be used to implement more complex logic or custom steps within the workflow.Comprehensive Error HandlingImplementing comprehensive error handling is crucial for the reliability of the deep research tool. Each stage of the workflow, from querying SearXNG to generating reports with Gemini, should include mechanisms to catch and handle potential errors. This might involve handling network errors when communicating with external APIs, parsing errors when processing web content, or API errors returned by SearXNG or Gemini. Strategies for error handling include logging errors for debugging and monitoring purposes, and potentially implementing retry mechanisms for transient failures. Robust error handling ensures that the tool can gracefully handle unexpected issues and maintain a high level of reliability.Data Management & PersistenceReliable data management and persistence are essential for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the deep research tool.Reliable Persistence OptionsFor the txtai index, several persistence options are available, including SQLite, DuckDB, and file-based storage. SQLite and DuckDB are both embedded relational databases that can store the index data in a single file, offering a good balance between performance and ease of use. File-based storage might involve saving the index as a set of files in a specified directory. The choice of persistence option depends on factors such as the anticipated size of the index, the performance requirements for retrieval, and the ease of management. Given the hardware limitations, a lightweight and efficient option like SQLite or DuckDB might be preferable. Regardless of the option chosen, ensuring data integrity is paramount for accurate retrieval and report generation. Regular backups of the persisted index are also recommended.Deployment & FeasibilityDeploying the deep research tool on the specified hardware requires careful consideration of the resource constraints.Confirming Basic Feasibility on Specified HardwareThe specified hardware (i3 3rd gen, 16GB DDR3 RAM, SSD) represents a relatively modest configuration. Running SearXNG, txtai (with a model like all-MiniLM-L6-v2), and the RAG pipeline on this hardware is likely feasible for generating reports where processing time is not the primary concern. SearXNG has relatively low resource requirements. The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model is designed to be efficient and should run within the 16GB RAM limit, although indexing larger datasets might take time. The Gemini API is an external service, so the computational load for the LLM part will be offloaded. However, potential performance limitations should be acknowledged. Indexing might be slower compared to more powerful hardware, and generating very long or complex reports might also take time. The SSD will help with faster data access compared to a traditional HDD. Overall, with a focus on a smaller embedding model and accepting potentially longer processing times, the tool should be functionally feasible on the specified hardware.Structuring docker-compose.ymlA basic structure for the docker-compose.yml file would involve defining services for SearXNG and the application running txtai and the Gemini API integration. An example is shown below:YAMLversion: '3.8'
services:
  searxng:
    image: searxng/searxng:latest
    container_name: searxng
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      -./searxng_data:/etc/searxng
    networks:
      - research_network
    restart: unless-stopped

  research_app:
    build:./research_app  # Path to your application's Dockerfile
    container_name: research_app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"  # Example port for your application
    environment:
      - SEARXNG_HOST=http://searxng:8080
      - GEMINI_API_KEY=${GEMINI_API_KEY}
    volumes:
      -./txtai_index:/app/txtai_index
      -./data:/app/data
    depends_on:
      - searxng
    networks:
      - research_network
    restart: unless-stopped

networks:
  research_network:
    driver: bridge
This docker-compose.yml defines two services: searxng using the official SearXNG image, and research_app which would be built from a Dockerfile located in the ./research_app directory. Ports are mapped for external access (8080 for SearXNG and 5000 as an example for the research application). Volumes are defined for persisting SearXNG data and the txtai index. The research_app is configured to depend on searxng and is linked to the same network for communication. Environment variables can be used to pass configuration details like the SearXNG host and the Gemini API key. Traefik can be integrated by adding a service definition for it and configuring appropriate labels for routing requests to searxng and research_app based on hostnames or paths.Trade-offs, Recommendations, and ConclusionBuilding a deep research tool with the specified components involves several trade-offs, primarily between the complexity of implementation and the quality of the generated reports. For instance, implementing advanced RAG techniques like graph context could potentially enhance report quality but would significantly increase the complexity of the system and its resource usage. Similarly, choosing larger embedding models for txtai might improve semantic fidelity but could strain the hardware resources.For maximizing report quality using the Google Gemini API, it is recommended to explore the capabilities of the more advanced Gemini models (e.g., Pro or Ultra if accessible via the API), as these models are likely to offer better reasoning and synthesis capabilities compared to more basic models. Prompt engineering should focus on providing clear instructions to Gemini, organizing the retrieved context effectively, and encouraging analytical and multi-faceted responses.Key strategies for enhancing report accuracy, depth, and comprehensiveness include:
Formulating precise and targeted search queries for SearXNG, leveraging its categories and engine selection capabilities.9
Thoroughly cleaning and pre-processing the content retrieved from SearXNG to ensure high-quality input for txtai.
Choosing an appropriate text chunking strategy that balances semantic coherence with the context window limitations of Gemini.
Configuring txtai with an efficient yet semantically accurate embedding model like all-MiniLM-L6-v2, and ensuring robust metadata storage for citation.
Developing effective prompts for Gemini that guide it to synthesize information deeply, perform analysis, and generate multi-faceted reports.
Implementing precise citation handling to link Gemini's output back to the original sources.
In conclusion, building the proposed deep research tool using a self-hosted SearXNG instance, txtai with local embeddings, and the Google Gemini Developer API is feasible on the specified hardware, especially with a focus on report quality over processing speed. Careful configuration of each component, strategic prompt engineering for Gemini, and a well-defined workflow will be crucial for achieving the desired outcome of generating high-quality, accurate, and comprehensive research reports. Potential future enhancements could involve exploring more advanced RAG techniques and continuously evaluating the performance and quality of the system.
